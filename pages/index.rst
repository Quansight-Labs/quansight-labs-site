Quansight Labs is a public-benefit division of Quansight created to provide a
home for a “PyData Core Team” which consists of developers, community
managers, designers, and writers who create and maintain open-source
technology around all aspects of scientific and data science workflows.


Sustaining the future of Open Source
------------------------------------

Projects like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Jupyter, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Dask,
Conda, and many others serve as a foundation for data science workflows and a
launchpad for AI. We have had and continue to have the privilege of
participating in these communities and understand personally the need for
people to be funded to work on these projects. We also understand the needs
of companies that use these projects, and aim to connect communities and
companies to guarantee the health and accelerate development of the projects
and technology that tens of millions of users rely on.

See our :doc:`Mission, Vision and Model <about>` for more.
