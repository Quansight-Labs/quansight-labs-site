involving more users in the community and making Spyder useful for a larger
number of people. With this, a new idea came: Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past months, we have been wondering with the team whether Spyder
could also serve as a teaching-learning platform, especially in this era
where remote instruction has become necessary. We submitted a proposal to the
Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program of the Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative, during its third cycle, with the idea of providing a
simple way inside Spyder to create and share interactive tutorials on topics
relevant to scientific research. Unfortunately, we didn’t get this funding,
but we didn’t let this great idea die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We submitted a second proposal to the &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/psf/"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
from which we were awarded $4000. For me, this is the perfect opportunity for
us to take the first step towards using Spyder for education.&lt;/p&gt;

Six months ago I started a project with &lt;a href="https://github.com/CAM-Gerlach"&gt;CAM Gerlach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ccordoba12"&gt;Carlos Cordoba&lt;/a&gt; to improve Spyder’s documentation. At first, I didn’t actually understand how important docs are for software, especially for open source projects. However, during all this time I’ve learned how documentation has a huge impact on the open-source community and I’ve been thankful to have been able to do this. But, from the beginning, I asked myself “why am I the ‘right person’ for this?”&lt;/p&gt;
