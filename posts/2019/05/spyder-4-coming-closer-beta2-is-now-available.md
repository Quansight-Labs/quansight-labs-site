It has been almost two months since I joined Quansight, last April, to start 
working with [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/) maintenance and 
development. So far, it has been a very exciting and rewarding journey under 
the guidance of long time Spyder maintainer
[Carlos Córdoba](https://github.com/ccordoba12).
This is the first of a series of blog posts we will be writing to showcase 
updates on the development of Spyder, new planned features and news on the 
road to Spyder 4.0 and beyond.

Before we describe the features that will be included in the imminent release 
of Spyder 4.0beta2, I would like to give a warm welcome to
[Edgar Margffoy](https://github.com/andfoy),
who recently joined Quansight, and will be working with the Spyder team to
take its development even further. Edgar has been a core Spyder developer 
for more than two years and we are very excited to have his (almost)
full-time commitment to the project.

# Spyder 4.0 beta2 release!

Since August 2018, when the first Beta of the 4.x series was released, the
Spyder development team has been working really hard on its next release,
4.0 Beta2. The past couple of months we added the long awaited dark theme
for the entire interface, we switched our entire code completion and linting
architecture to the
[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
which opens the door to support many other
programming languages, and we merged several other goodies!

## Dark Theme

This has been a
[long awaited feature](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/2350)
and will be the default theme for this new version. Users can still select the
traditional OS specific theme by going to the **Appearance** section in our
**Preferences** dialog.

This enhancement was enabled by the work of
[Colin Duquesnoy](https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy) and
[Daniel Pizzeta](https://github.com/DPizzeta)
and their [QDarkStyle](https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/)
package. The Spyder team is now actively collaborating with Colin and Daniel
to pursue the release of QDarkStyle 3.x, which will be using the
[qtsass](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtsass/)
package to harness the power of SASS/SCSS and allow users to fully customize
the theme dynamically.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so without further ado, here it is:

Pretty, right :-) ?

<!-- TEASER_END -->

## Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation

The LSP was created by Microsoft for Visual Studio Code to standardize the
way in which development tools (i.e. editors and IDEs) communicate with
servers that provide code completion, linting and related facilities for
different programming languages. With this, as
[they](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) describe it:

>A single Language Server can be reused in multiple development
tools, which in turn can support multiple languages with minimal effort.
LSP is a win for both language providers and tooling vendors!

Since our 4.0beta2 version, Spyder is now one of such development tools! We
developed our own client to communicate with any server that implements the
LSP v3.0 through a transport layer that uses ZeroMQ sockets. Code completion,
signatures and docstring extraction were rewritten to take advantage of this
architecture, and mouse hovers were added too (other LSP features, such as
workspace functionality, will come in future betas).

Our current support is geared towards Python, using the great
[Python-Language-Server](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server)
package. This has allowed us to provide fine-grained configurability for
[Pycodestyle](http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/stable/) and
[Pydocstyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/) options, and in future
betas we’ll also add the ability to use and configure code formatters such
as yapf and autopep8.

We offer support to configure LSP servers  for other programming languages
as well. In the future we hope to include out-of-the-box support for
programming languages in the scientific computing spectrum, such as
Fortran, Julia and C/C++.

## Plots pane

Following the steps and inspiration of RStudio, another well known IDE in the
Data Science space, Spyder now includes a Plots viewer pane. Since beta2 plots
generated in every console will be displayed there, and the pane will be
updated automatically to only show the plots of the current one. Besides,
users will have the ability to browse the history of all plots generated in a
session.

## And much more

There are many more features that have been developed in the previous 10
months! These include:

1. **Autosave** files in the editor. With this Spyder will recover your
unsaved files in case it crashes before you save them. 
2. Dedicated **Sympy**, **Cython** and **Pylab** consoles. This will make it
very simple to quickly explore and create code for these libraries.
3. OS level **window pane undocking**. This will allow users to easily
organize panes in different monitors.
4. Support for **[multi-indexes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html)**
in our Dataframe viewer.

We will describe all of these additional enhancements in greater detail in
future blog posts.

## How can you help?

If you are a Spyder user and would like to help us test this beta release, you
can do so by installing it with conda, from our beta releases channel:

```bash
$ conda update qt pyqt
$ conda install spyder=4.0.0b2 --channel spyder-ide
```

This is a safe process because Spyder now uses a different configuration
directory for its beta versions, so you can easily switch between our stable
and beta releases without fearing of damage to your current installation.

If you find any issues, you can report them on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues).

## Closing Remarks

I would like to thank Quansight for the opportunity of working in open source
development on an awesome product such as Spyder. I would also like to thank
the users, [contributors](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors)
and [core developers](https://github.com/orgs/spyder-ide/people) for helping
make Spyder an awesome tool!
