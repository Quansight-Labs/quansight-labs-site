    "# `uarray`: A Generic Override Framework for Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "`uarray` is an override framework for methods in Python. In the scientific Python ecosystem, and in other similar places, there has been one recurring problem: That similar tools to do a job have existed, but don't conform to a single, well-defined API. `uarray` tries to solve this problem in general, but also for the scientific Python ecosystem in particular, by defining APIs independent of their implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Array Libraries in the Scientific Python Ecosystem\n",
    "When SciPy was created, and Numeric and Numarray unified into NumPy, it jump-started Python's data science community. The ecosystem grew quickly: Academics started moving to SciPy, and the Scikits that popped up made the transition all the more smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the scientific Python community also shifted during that time: GPUs and distributed computing emerged. Also, there were old ideas that couldn't really be used with NumPy's API, such as sparse arrays. To solve these problems, various libraries emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dask, for distributed NumPy\n",
    "- CuPy, for NumPy on Nvidia-branded GPUs.\n",
    "- PyData/Sparse, a project started to make sparse arrays conform to the NumPy API\n",
    "- Xnd, which extends the type system and the universal function concept found in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- TEASER_END -->\n",
    "\n",
    "There were yet other libraries that emerged: PyTorch, which mimics NumPy to a certain degree; TensorFlow, which defines its own API; and MXNet, which is another deep learning framework that mimics NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "The problem is, stated simply: How do we use all of these libraries in tandem, moving seamlessly from one to the other, without actually changing the API, or even the imports? How do we take functions written for one library and allow it to be used by another, without, as Travis Oliphant so eloquently puts it, \"re-writing the world\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "In my mind, the goals are (stated abstractly):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Methods that are not tied to a specific implementation.\n",
    "  * For example `np.arange`\n",
    "2. Backends that implement these methods.\n",
    "  * NumPy, Dask, PyTorch are all examples of this.\n",
    "3. Coercion of objects to other forms to move between backends.\n",
    "  * This means converting a NumPy array to a Dask array, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we wanted to be able to do this for arbitrary objects. So `dtype`s, `ufunc`s etc. should also be dispatchable and coercible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution?\n",
    "With that said, let's dive into `uarray`. If you're not interested in the gory details, you can jump down to <a href=\"#how-to-use-it\">this section</a>."
