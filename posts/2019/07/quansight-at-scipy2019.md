Yesterday the SciPy'19 conference ended. It was a lot of fun, and very productive. You can really feel that there's a lot of energy in the community, and that it's growing and maturing. This post is just a quick update to summarize Quansight's presence and contributions, as well as some of the more interesting things I noticed.

## A few highlights

The "Open Source Communities" track, which had a strong emphasis on topics like burnout, diversity and sustainability, as well as the keynotes by Stuart Geiger ("_The Invisible Work of Maintaining and Sustaining Open-Source Software_") and Carol Willing ("_Jupyter: Always Open for Learning and Discovery_") showed that many more people and projects are paying more attention to and evolving their thinking on the human and organizational aspects of open source. 

I did not go to many technical talks, but did make sure to catch Matt Rocklin's talk "_Refactoring the SciPy Ecosystem for Heterogeneous Computing_". Matt clearly explained some key issues and opportunities around the state of array computing libraries in Python - I highly recommend watching this talk.

Abigail Cabunoc Mayes' talk "_Work Open, Lead Open (#WOLO) for Sustainability_" was fascinating - it made me rethink the governance models and roles we use for our projects, and I worked on some of her concrete suggestions during the sprints.

Finally, the number of people interested in helping grow the community and projects was a highlight. In my own talk I identified a number of things that we (the NumPy project) were not doing well or not doing at all, and for literally every single concrete item or action I mentioned I had one or more people come up to me to volunteer their time and expertise. So I'll definitely be sticking my hand up with a "we could really use some help here" more often in the coming months.

## Contributions by Quansight people

**Carol Willing** gave a fascinating keynote, _Jupyter: Always Open for Learning and Discovery_. 

**Anthony Scopatz** must have lost out on some sleep: he gave a talk, _Inequality of Underrepresented Groups in Core Project Leadership_, co-taught two tutorials, _Xonsh - Bringing Python Data Science to your Shell_ and _RAPIDS: Open GPU Data Science_, and entertailed us hosting the lightning talks every day (together with Paul Ivanov).

**Aaron Meurer** taught the RAPIDS tutorial with Anthony, and co-organized a Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session about SymPy.

I gave a talk, _Inside NumPy: Preparing for the Next Decade_ and co-organized and moderated a BoF: _Mechanisms and Governance Issues for Funding Open Source Software in Science_ (a lot of ideas to follow up on from that!).

**Chris Ostrouchov**, **Travis Oliphant**, and **Ivan Ogasawara** gave lightning talks (I may be forgetting someone here, it was impossible to keep track of everything that was going on). **James Bourbeau** and **Dharhas Pothina** were also present; all of us stayed for the sprints, where we did everything from helping new people make their first open source contributions to in-depth design discussions, code review, and sketching out how the organizational structure of NumPy should be transformed.

I hope to see many of you at SciPy'20 next year!
