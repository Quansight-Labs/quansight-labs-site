    "`uarray` is a generic override framework for objects and methods in Python. Since [my last `uarray` blogpost](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/04/uarray-intro/), there have been plenty of developments, changes to the API and improvements to the overhead of the protocol. Let’s begin with a walk-through of the current feature set and API, and then move on to current developments and how it compares to [`__array_function__`](www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html). For further details on the API and latest developments, please see [the API page for `uarray`](https://uarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/uarray.html). The examples there are doctested, so they will always be current."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "### Other array objects\n",
    "NumPy is a simple, rectangular, dense, and in-memory data store. This is great for some applications but isn't complete on its own. It doesn't encompass every single use-case. The following are examples of array objects available today that have different features and cater to a different kind of audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dask is one of the most popular ones. It allows distributed and chunked computation.\n",
    "* CuPy is another popular one, and allows GPU computation.\n",
    "* PyData/Sparse is slowly gaining popularity, and is a sparse, in-memory data store.\n",
    "* XArray includes named dimensions.\n",
    "* Xnd is another effort to re-write and modernise the NumPy API, and includes support for GPU arrays and ragged arrays.\n",
    "* Another effort (although with no Python wrapper, only data marshalling) is XTensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of these, Dask and XArray have the ability to wrap or compose objects that are not `numpy.ndarray`s. There are many other libraries (a popular one being scikit-learn) that need a back-end mechanism in order to be able to support different kinds of array objects. There is a desire to see SciPy itself gain support for other array objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `__array_function__` and its limitations\n",
    "One of my motivations for working on `uarray` were the limitations of the `__array_function__` protocol, defined in [this proposal](https://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html). The limitations are threefold:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can only dispatch on array objects.\n",
    "* Consequently, it can only dispatch on functions that *accept* array objects.\n",
    "* It has no mechanism for conversion and coercion.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations have been [partially](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11129) [discussed](http://numpy-discussion.10968.n7.nabble.com/Allowing-broadcasting-of-code-dimensions-in-generalized-ufuncs-td45589.html) [before](http://numpy-discussion.10968.n7.nabble.com/Proposal-to-accept-NEP-18-array-function-protocol-td46001.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## `uarray` — The solution?\n",
    "With that out of the way, let's explore `uarray`, a library that hopes to resolve these issues, and even though the original motivation was NumPy and array computing, the library itself is meant to be a generic multiple-dispatch mechanism."

    "## The overhead of `uarray`\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the limiting factors in the adoption of `uarray` has been its overhead. This is currently [being brought down](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/uarray/pull/170) by [Peter Bell](https://github.com/peterbell10), a GSoC student working on `uarray`, who is working on a C++ implementation of the protocol. As of the last version, the overhead on my machine was about 1.37 μs per call, and this is still being worked on. You can follow the [updates on Peter’s work here](https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/blogs/peterbell10s-blog/). It is also being [merged into `scipy.fft`](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/10383) as part of his ongoing GSoC work."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "`uarray` provides a strong contender for a multiple-dispatch solution for array computing, and an alternative to `__array_function__`. While it is more feature-complete, it also needs a bit more boilerplate and has higher overhead than `__array_function__`. Here's to hoping for more options in the array computing space, and to separating the API from the implementation, which always opens more pathways to future improvement."
