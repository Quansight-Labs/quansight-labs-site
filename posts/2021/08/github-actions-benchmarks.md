Benchmarking software is a tricky business. For robust results, you need dedicated
hardware that only runs the benchmarking suite under controlled conditions. No other
processes! No OS updates! Nothing else! Even then, you might find out that CPU throttling,
thermal regulation and other issues can introduce noise in your measurements.

So, how are we even trying to do it on a CI provider like GitHub Actions?
Every job runs in a separate VM instance with frequent updates and shared resources. It
looks like it would just be a very expensive random number generator.

Well, it turns out that there _is_ a sensible way to do it: **relative benchmarking**.
And we know it works because we have been collecting stability data points for several
weeks.

# Good benchmarking on shared resources?

Speed-critical projects use benchmark suites to track performance over time and detect
regressions from commit to commit. For these measurements to be useful, they need to
be comparable and hence use the exact same conditions for each data point. Guaranteeing
this in absolute manners can be a daunting task, but there are ways around it.

Instead of going through all the complications involved in renting or acquiring dedicated
hardware, setting up credentials and monitoring costs, we hoped we could use the same free
cloud resources normally used for CI tests. Ideally, GitHub Actions.

Let's compare the requirements for good benchmarks and the features provided by CI services.
That way we can understand how to work around some of the apparent limitations:

| A good benchmark suite... | CI services... |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| runs on the same hardware every time | provide a different (standardized) machine for each run |
| runs on dedicated hardware | run on shared resources |
| runs on a frozen OS configuration | update their VM images often |
| requires renting or acquiring such hardware | are free |
| requires authentication mechanisms | implement authentication out of the box |
| requires hardware that can be abused through public PRs &nbsp; | are designed for public PRs |

<br />

Looking at that table we see that CI services are attractive because of the cost and setup, but
fail to provide some of the essential quality factors for reliable benchmarking. That is, if
we want to track performance over time and compare absolute measurements directly.

What if we only want to detect regressions introduced in a PR? Or in the current commit against
the last release? We do not need absolute measurements, just a way to _compare_ two commits in
a reliable way. This is exactly what we meant by _relative benchmarking_.

The idea is to run the benchmarking suite in the same CI job for the two commits we are comparing. This
way, we guarantee we are using the exact same machine and configuration for both. By doing this, we
are essentially canceling out the background noise and can estimate the performance _ratio_ of
the two commits.

There are some gotchas, though. Benchmark suites can take long to run, and running them twice
makes it even worse. This opens an even larger time window for other CI jobs to pollute our
measurements with resource-intensive tasks that happen to be running at the same time.
To minimize these effects, benchmarking tools run the tests several times in different
schedules and apply some statistics to correct for the inevitable deviations. Or, at least,
_try_.


# Relative performance measurements with Airspeed Velocity

`scikit-image`, the project that commissioned this task, uses
[Airspeed Velocity](https://asv.readthedocs.io/), or `asv`, for their benchmark tests.

`asv`'s main feature is being able to track performance measurements over time in a JSON database and generate
beautiful dashboards that can be published to a static site server like GitHub Pages. For
an example, look at the reports for `pandas` at their [speed.pydata.org](https://pandas.pydata.org/speed/pandas/)
website.

`asv` _also_ has a special subcommand named `continuous`, which might provide the
functionally we needed. The help message says:

> Run a side-by-side comparison of two commits for continuous integration.

This sounds like exactly what we are looking for! Let's break down how it works:

1. When we run `asv continuous A B`, `asv` will create at least two<sup>†</sup> virtual environments
(one per commit) and install revisions A and B in those, respectively. If the project
involves compiled libraries (as is the case with `scikit-image`), this can be a lengthy
process!
2. The default configuration will run the benchmark in two interleaved passes, with several
repeats each. In other words, `asv` will run the suite four times (`A->B->A->B`)! This is done to account
for the unavoidable deviations from ideality caused from co-running processes, as mentioned above.
3. The statistics for each commit are gathered and a report table is presented. The ratio
of each test is computed and, if it is greater than a certain threshold (`1.2` by default)
an error is emitted.

> <sup>†</sup> `asv` supports the notion of a configuration matrix, so you can test your code under
different environments; e.g. NumPy versions, Python interpreters, etc.

For the benchmark suite of `scikit-image` as of June/July 2021, this ends up taking up to two hours.
This raises two questions we will answer in the following sections:

1. Although we are trying hard to reduce measurement errors, is that enough? Are these measurements reliable?
2. Two hours might be too long. Are there any settings we can tune to reduce the runtime
without reducing the accuracy of the measurements?

# Are CI services reliable enough for benchmarking?

We saw above that CI services are not designed for this kind of task, but with some workarounds
they might be good enough. However, how can we be sure? As data-driven scientists, we say let's run
an experiment!

## The setup

If our experiment is data-driven, we should generate some data first. This is our strategy:

* We will benchmark and compare two commits that are exactly the same in terms of tested code.
* Under ideal conditions, we should see that the performance ratio between the two commits is `1.0`.
In other words, performance should be the same. Of course, these are not ideal conditions, so
some kind of error is expected. We just want it to stay reliably under an acceptable threshold.
* We will implement a GitHub Actions workflow that will run every six hours (four times a day) and
collect results for a week or more. This will help us account for two things:
    * Accumulate sufficient data points to answer our question.
    * Account for time factors like different days of the week (e.g. weekday vs weekend),
      or the time of the day (3am vs 3pm).
* The workflow will upload the benchmark results as artifacts we can download and process locally
  with a Jupyter Notebook.

## The results

To measure the stability of the different benchmark runs we will be looking at the performance
ratio of the measurements between the two commits. Since they are identical in terms of tested code,
ideally they should be all `1.0`. We know this will not happen, but maybe the errors are not that big
and stay like that regardless the time of the day or the day of the week.

After collecting data points for 16 days, these are the results:

![Reliability of benchmarks in GitHub Actions. This 2D plots shows a 16-day timeseries in the X axis.
  Each data point in the X axis corresponds to a cloud of 75 measurements (one per benchmark test).
  The y-axis spread of each cloud corresponds to the performance ratio. Ideal measurements would have
  a performance ratio of 1.0, since both runs returned the exact same performance. In practice this
  does not happen and we can observe ratios between 0.5 and 1.5. The configuration depicted in this
  particular plot shows that while there is an observable y-spread, it is small enough to be considered
  sensitive to performance regressions of more than 50%.](/images/2021/08/github-actions-benchmark.png)

* Average time taken: 1h55min
* Minimum and maximum ratios observed: 0.51, 1.36
* Mean and standard deviation of ratios: 1.00, 0.05
* Proportion of false positives: 4/108 = 3.7%

In the X axis you can see the different runs, sorted by date and time. Days of the week are grouped
with colored patches for easier visual analysis. In the Y axis, we plot the performance ratio. Each
of those vertical clouds include 75 points, one per benchmark test. Ideally, they should all fall at
`y=1`. Of course, not all of them are there, but a surprising amount of them do!

But! We do see some bigger deviations at certain times! How is that possible? Well, that's the error we were talking about!
These outliers are the ones that would concern us because they can be interpreted as **false positives**.
In other words: `asv` would report a performance regression, when in fact there's none. However,
in the observed measurements, the outliers were always within `y ∈ (0.5, 1.4)`.
That means we can affirm that the method is sensitive enough to detect performance regressions of 50% or
more! This is good enough for our project and, in fact, some projects might even be happy with a threshold of `2.0`.

# Can we make it run faster without losing accuracy?

We just found out that this approach is sensitive enough _but_ it takes two hours to run. Is it possible
to reduce that time without sacrificing sensitivity? We need to remember that `asv` is running several
passes and repeats to reduce the measurement error, but maybe some of those default counter-measures
are not needed. Namely:

- The benchmark runs with `--interleave-processes`, but it can be disabled with `--no-interleave-processes`.
The help message for this flag says:

    > Interleave benchmarks with multiple processes across commits. This can avoid measurement biases
    > from commit ordering, can take longer.

    How much longer? Does it help keep error under control? We should measure that.

- By default, all tests are run several times, with different schedules. There are two
[benchmark attributes](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/benchmarks.html#timing-benchmarks)
that govern these settings: `processes` and `repeat`. `processes` defaults to `2`, which means that
the full suite will be run twice per commit. If we only do one pass (`processes=1`), we will reduce
the running time in half, but will we lose too much accuracy?

To answer both questions, we added more entries to the data collection workflow shown above by
[parameterizing the `asv` command-line options](https://github.com/jaimergp/scikit-image/blob/e561996/.github/workflows/benchmarks-cron.yml#L14-L23).

These are the results!

## No process interleaving

Disabling process interleaving should be faster and maybe the accuracy loss is not that bad. But...
how bad? Here are the results:

![Reliability of benchmarks in GitHub Actions, no interleaving. This 2D plots shows a 16-day timeseries in the X axis.
  Each data point in the X axis corresponds to a cloud of 75 measurements (one per benchmark test).
  The y-axis spread of each cloud corresponds to the performance ratio. Ideal measurements would have
  a performance ratio of 1.0, since both runs returned the exact same performance. In practice this
  does not happen. With no interleaving, the vertical spread is more evident, with several clouds
  spreading beyond the desired interval. One particular outlier happened on the first Saturday,
  with half the cloud below 0.75.](/images/2021/08/github-actions-benchmark-no-interleaving.png)

* Average time taken: 1h39min
* Minimum and maximum ratios observed: 0.43, 1.5
* Mean and standard deviation of ratios: 0.99, 0.07
* Proportion of false positives: 6/66 = 9.99%

## Single-pass with `processes=1`

In this configuration, we expect a drastic 50% running time reduction, since we will only do one pass
per commit, instead of two. However, the accuracy loss might be too dramatic... Let's see!

![Reliability of benchmarks in GitHub Actions, single pass. This 2D plots shows a 16-day timeseries in the X axis.
  Each data point in the X axis corresponds to a cloud of 75 measurements (one per benchmark test).
  The y-axis spread of each cloud corresponds to the performance ratio. Ideal measurements would have
  a performance ratio of 1.0, since both runs returned the exact same performance. In practice this
  does not happen. With a single process, the y-spread is significantly wider. Some data points can
  be observed even beyond a ratio of 2.5 (it should be 1.0!), and the overall visual spread is
  larger; i.e. the clouds are taller than in the ideal case of having a small, contained cloud at 1.0.
  ](/images/2021/08/github-actions-benchmark-single-process.png)

* Average time taken: 1h7min
* Minimum and maximum ratios observed: 0.51, 2.76
* Mean and standard deviation of ratios: 1.01, 0.07
* Proportion of false positives: 8/64 = 12.5%

At first sight, those clouds look very spread! The number of false positives is also larger.

## Summary of the strategies

Let's take a look at the three strategies now. The main columns are **runtime** and **%FP**
(percentage of false positives). We want the smallest %FP at the shortest runtime.

| Strategy        | Runtime  &nbsp;| %FP  | Min  | Max  | Mean &nbsp;| Std  |
|-----------------|---------|-------|------|------|------|------|
| Default         | 1h55    | 3.7  | 0.51 &nbsp;| 1.36 | 1.00 | 0.05 |
| No interleaving &nbsp;| 1h39    | 9.99 &nbsp;| 0.43 | 1.50 | 0.99 | 0.07 |
| Single pass     | 1h07    | 12.5 | 0.51 | 2.76 &nbsp;| 1.01 | 0.07 |

<br />

Unsurprisingly, the default strategy (two passes, interleaved) is the most accurate, but also
the most time consuming. Disabling process interleaving helps reduce the average runtime 16min
but the false positives increased to more than double! Using a single pass brought the runtime
down to an hour, but multiplied the false positives by almost four.

In short, we will stick to the default strategy for accuracy but need to investigate other ways
to make it run in less time.

# Speeding up compilation times

So far we have only looked at speeding up the benchmark suite itself, but we saw
earlier that `asv` will also spend some time setting up virtual environments and installing the
project. Since installing `scikit-learn` involves compiling some extensions, this can add up
to a non-trivial amount of time.

To accelerate the creation of the virtual environments, which in our case uses `conda`, we
replaced the `conda` calls with a faster implementation called `mamba`. We rely on an `asv`
implementation detail: to find `conda`, `asv` will first check the value of the `CONDA_EXE`
environment variable. This is normally set by `conda activate <env>`, but we
[overwrite it with the path to `mamba`](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/main/.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml#L77)
to have `asv` use it instead.

The second optimization is leveraging the use of a compiler cache. Since most of the modules
will not change in a given PR, we can use `ccache` to keep the unchanged libraries around. Check
the [workflow file](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/main/.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml#L36-L56)
to see how it can be implemented on GitHub Actions.

These two changes together brought the average running time down to around 1h 20min. Not bad!


# Run it on demand!

Benchmarks do not need to run for every single commit pushed to a PR. In fact, that's probably
a waste of resources. Instead, we'd like the maintainers to run the benchmarks on demand, whenever
needed during the PR lifetime.

GitHub Actions offers different kinds of events that will trigger a worklow. By default the
`on.pull_request` trigger is configured to act on three event types: `[opened, reopened, synchronize]`.
In practice, this means after every push or after closing+opening the PR. However, there are
[more triggers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request)!

Of all the choices, we settled for `labeled`. This means that the workflow will be triggered whenever
the PR is tagged with a label. To specify which label(s) are able to trigger the workflow, you can use
an `if` clause at the `job` level, [like this](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/2fa66e5/.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml#L10):

```yaml
name: Benchmark

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  benchmark:
    if: ${{ github.event.label.name == 'run-benchmark' && github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
    name: Linux
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    ...
```

In this example, the PR will only get triggered if the label is named `run-benchmark`. This works surprisingly
well as a manual trigger! It is also restricted to authorized users (triaging permissions or above), so no
need to fiddle with authentication tokens or similar complications.

There is one gotcha, though: the checks UI will be appended to the last push event panel, which can be confusing
if more commits have been added to the PR since the label was added. Ideally, the checks UI panel would be
added next to the _@user added the run-benchmark label_ message. Maybe in a
[future update](https://twitter.com/jaime_rgp/status/1412419232340627467)?


# TLDR

We have seen that GitHub Actions is indeed good enough to perform relative benchmarking in a reliable way
as long as several passes are averaged together (default behaviour in `asv continuous`). This takes a bit
more time but you can speed it up a bit with `mamba` and `ccache` for compiled libraries. Even in that case,
it is probably overkill to run it for every push event, so we are using the `on.pull_request.labeled` trigger
to let the maintainers decide when to do it on demand.
