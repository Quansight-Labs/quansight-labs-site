Few things hinder productivity more than interruption. A notification, random
realization, or unrelated error can derail one's train of thought when deep in a
complex analysis â€“ a frustrating experience.

In the software development context, forgetting to import a statement in an
interactive Jupyter session is such an experience. This can be especially
frustrating when using typical abbreviations, like `np`, `pd`, `plt`, where the
meaning is obvious to the human reader, but not to the computer. The
time-to-first-plot, and ability to quickly cleanup one's notebook afterward
are critical to an enjoyable and efficient workflow.

In this blogpost we present [pyflyby](https://github.com/deshaw/pyflyby), a
project and an extension to IPython and
[JupyterLab](https://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-pyflyby), that, among many
things, automatically inserts imports and tidies Python files and notebooks.

# What is pyflyby?

Pyflyby is a set of tools designed to improve interactive and non-interactive
workflows in Python. Pyflyby provides a number of utilities and extensions aimed
at making day-to-day work in Python faster and simpler.

## Autoimport

One of pyflyby's key capabilities is automatic importing of commonly used
modules and objects, leading to simpler, faster, and less disruptive coding. In
a new session, for example, one can type:

```python
sin(arange(10))
```

Pyflyby will then hook into the execution mechanism of Python, execute the
correct import, and confirm with a clear message:

```text
[PYFLYBY] from numpy import arange
[PYFLYBY] from numpy import sin
```

Pyflyby will also do so when running a command line file via
the `py` executable replacing python.

With the [jupyterlab-pyflyby](https://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-pyflyby) extension, imports will be executed and inserted in
the first cell of one's notebook:

## tidy-import

In addition to the extension that can seamlessly import the right libraries
while exploring, another pyflyby feature helps to maintain scripts and notebooks
with explicit and correct imports.

Pyflyby displays the `tidy-import` command line tool to gather, insert, and
format imports in Python files. This is similar to tools such as
[black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) and
[isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/), but with different styling options and
with the ability to infer missing imports.


`tidy-import` includes the imports to pandas and matplotlib, as in the example
below, and queries whether to update the file:

```diff
$ tidy-imports example.py
[PYFLYBY] example.py: added 'import pandas as pd'
[PYFLYBY] example.py: added 'from matplotlib import pyplot'
--- example.py	2021-03-08 10:33:04.000000000 -0800

```

## Other utilities

Pyflyby contains a number of other utilities to improve the efficiency of
manipulating and executing Python code. (Please refer to pyflyby's
[README](https://github.com/deshaw/pyflyby) for additional information.)

`py` is one such example. It is a flexible tool that can be used either to start
IPython or to execute commands quickly from the developer's shell without the
need for imports. It supports a range of syntax options, allowing for quick
calculation and graph plotting.

 - Without any parameters, `py` will start IPython with the pyflyby extension
   activated.
 - With space-separated arguments, `py` will attempt to interpret each argument
   as a Python function call with the right imports:


```bash
$ py np.random.normal 0 1
[PYFLYBY] import numpy as np
[PYFLYBY] np.random.normal(0, 1)
-0.027577422117386
```

- When more control over values is necessary, `py` will run a Python expression:

```bash
$ py 'plot(scipy.stats.norm.pdf(linspace(-5, 5), 0, 1))'
[PYFLYBY] from numpy import linspace
[PYFLYBY] from matplotlib.pyplot import plot
[PYFLYBY] import scipy.stats
[PYFLYBY] plot(scipy.stats.norm.pdf(linspace(-5, 5), 0, 1))
[<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x132981940>]
```

`find-import` , another utility available in pyflyby, can be deployed to find a
particular function across many libraries by returning the relevant import.  For
example:

```bash
$ find-import norm
from scipy.stats.distributions import norm
```

# Notes on pyflyby codebase

The [Pyflyby codebase](https://github.com/deshaw/pyflyby) provides a window into
advanced data structures and programming paradigms. Its use of modules and
programming concepts is unusual relative to those found in more classical data
science-focused libraries. For example:

 - Pyflyby will conduct non-trivial manipulation of the Python Abstract Syntax
   Tree (AST), which represents code written in tree form. Pyflyby uses AST to
   find and insert missing imports, and it does so even as AST's exact
   representation changes with almost every minor release.

 - Pyflyby demonstrates the use of  [Aspect-Oriented
   programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming),
   which highlights the flexibility of the Python programming model.


# Conclusion

Pyflyby's utilities are designed to improve developer efficiency and materially
reduce the impact of interruption on productivity. Its value, however, is
broader than that. Pyflyby expands what one is capable of doing within the Python ecosystem
and has helped identify a number of limitations and bugs in Python and IPython
over time.

# How to get pyflyby

Pyflyby is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/deshaw/pyflyby) or, for
terminal IPython users:

```
$ pip install pyflyby
$ py pyflyby.install_in_ipython_config_file
```

JupyterLab users can also install [the JupyterLab
Extension](https://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-pyflyby), which is
notebook-aware and enables even more features.
