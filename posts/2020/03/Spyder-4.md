After more than three years in development, and comprising more than 5000 commits from 60 authors around the world, Spyder 4 finally saw the light in December 5th 2019! I decided to wait until now to make a formal announcement because quickly after the release we found several critical performance issues and some regressions with respect to Spyder 3, most of which are fixed now in version [4.1.0](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases), released on <...>.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

This new release comes with a lengthy list of user-requested features aimed at providing users an enhanced development experience at the level of top general-purpose editors and IDEs, while strengthening Spyder's specialized focus on scientific programming in Python. The interested reader can take a look at some of them in [previous](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/11/variable-explorer-improvements-in-Spyder-4/) [blog](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/11/File-management-improvements-in-Spyder4/) [posts](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/08/spyder-40-beta4-kite-integration-is-here/), and in detail in our [Changelog](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-400-2019-12-06). However, this post is not meant to describe these improvements but to acknowledge all people that contributed to make Spyder 4 possible.

Spyder 4 is the first version developed with financial support from several companies as well as donations by the international user community. But, as a project, we couldn't have been able to reach the level of maturity needed to receive and handle that support, without the pivotal opportunities Travis Oliphant, former CEO of Anaconda and current one of Quansight, gave me to work in Scientific Python. Thanks to him, I became part of Anaconda, Inc. in 2015, I was able to hire a small small team to improve Spyder within Anaconda in late 2016, and I entered Quansight to work solely on Spyder in 2018. As with other projects in our ecosystem, such as [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh), [Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask) and [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba), Spyder benefited immensely from Travis' trust in the role these projects and ours could play in the future. He certainly believed in the vision their maintainers worked so hard to make a reality of, even if their beginnings were humble and their chances of survival uncertain. Therefore, my first big acknowledgment is to Travis: thanks for giving us a chance!

I also want to thank our community for its continued support. As I've witnessed during my years as Spyder's lead developer, many newbies and veterans alike keep choosing Spyder as a viable alternative to do scientific programming in Python. It's really you, the members of this fantastic community, which maintain Spyder relevant in a highly competed field by using and contributing back to it. I'm honored and humbled to have received such first-class additions to Spyder 4 from our volunteer contributors as our new Plots pane, thanks to [Jean-Sébastien Gosselin](https://github.com/jnsebgosselin); a complete re-architecturing of our IPython console, which allowed a lot of improvements to our debugger, thanks to [Quentin Peter](https://github.com/impact27); auto-saving functionality for our editor, thanks to [Jitse Niesen](https://github.com/jitseniesen); the initial implementation of the `runcell` command, thanks to [Brian Olsen](https://github.com/bcolsen); and significant improvements to our documentation, thanks to [CAM Gerlach](https://github.com/CAM-Gerlach).

Besides, when the future looked grim, after my team and I were let go from Anaconda at the end of 2017 (not by Travis decision), a lot of users came to our rescue by making donations through our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/spyder). That, and a Numfocus development grant we received next year, filled us with confidence and allowed us to continue with Spyder's development in 2018, even after losing part of our team in the process.

Last year it was also a pleasant surprise to learn that several companies were interested in seeing Spyder prosper and thrive. Through Quansight Labs and its [Community Working Order](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/05/community-driven-opensource-funded-development/) concept, we were able to sign contracts with two of them: [TDK-Micronas](https://www.micronas.tdk.com/en) and [Kite](https://kite.com/). Their support was critical to finish Spyder 4 because it allowed me to hire most of my old Anaconda team back, plus two new additions, to work full-time on the project. Therefore, I can't them enough for showing up just at the right time!

And finally, even when I am the public face of Spyder, due to my presence in our [issues tracker](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/438386/carlos-cordoba), it's really the Spyder team that is in charge of implementing new features and fixing most bugs. So my last round of acknowledgments goes to them. I was fortunate enough to convince some of the most talented Colombian software developers to work for the project, and they did a hell of a job in this release!

For instance, [Gonzalo Peña-Castellanos](https://github.com/goanpeca/) helped us to greatly improve the usability experience of code completion and linting in the editor, to implement most enhancements to the Files pane, and to refactor and put in good shape our configuration system; [Edgar Margffoy](https://github.com/andfoy) single-handedly created a client to support the same [protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) used by VSCode to provide completion and linting for lots of programming languages, added snippet completions and vastly improved code folding in the editor; [Daniel Althviz](https://github.com/dalthviz) developed the necessary infrastructure to install and use Kite smoothly within Spyder, and added the new object explorer viewer to the Variable Explorer; and our Junior developers, [Stephannie Jimenez](https://github.com/steff456) and [Juanita Gomez](https://github.com/juanis2112), although still learning their way in our complex source code, managed to do important contributions, such as improving the icons we use per file type in Files (Juanita), and allowing to run code in an external system terminal on macOS (Stephannie).

I hope you enjoy the results of this massive effort! And happy Spydering!!
