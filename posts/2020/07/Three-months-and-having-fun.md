I joined Quansight at the beginning of April, splitting my time between
PyTorch (as part of a larger Quansight team) and contributing to Quansight Labs
supported community-driven projects in the Python scientific and data science
software stack, primarily to NumPy.  I have found my next home; the people, the
projects, and the atmosphere are an all around win-win for me and (I hope) for
the projects to which I contribute.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

I am not a newcomer to Open Source. I originally became involved in
[PyPy](https://www.pypy.org) as an after-hours hobby to hone my developer
skills, and quickly became enamoured with the people and the mission. Over the
years my efforts in the open source world moved more mainstream, and in 2018 I
took on a full-time position working on NumPy, funded through a grant to
[BIDS](https://bids.berkeley.edu). Since April 2020, I have moved to Quansight
Labs as a full-time developer. 

[Quansight Labs](https://www.quansight.com/labs) is a subsidiary of Quansight
LLC, and Labs' mission is "Sustaining the future of open source". It does this
by gathering together an amazing group of software developers and letting them
loose on a variety of open source projects: Numpy, Spyder, Jupyter, conda-forge,
Numba and [more](http://labs.quansight.org/categories). Of course, the
developers do not only volunteer their time. Quansight Labs is sponsored via

- generous support from Quansight LLC,
- grants like the one from [CZI for NumPy and
  OpenBLAS](http://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/11/numpy-openblas-CZI-grant),
- and via [community work
  orders](http://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/05/community-driven-opensource-funded-development/)
  from companies like D. E. Shaw who sponsor [work on
  Dask](http://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/08/labs-dask-update).

I personally split my sponsored time between PyTorch and NumPy, and in my free
time contribute to other projects like PyPy, helping with Python packaging, and
more.

In the past three months I have met a whole new group of developers. We all
work remotely, and meet up on Slack and video calls. In the past, the entire
team would meet once a year or so, until face-to-face gatherings were put on hold. But that does
not stop the interactions. The organization, with over 20 developers, has
little hierarchy. Interactions are direct and it is customary to meet up
for virtual coffee or just to chat. Since we all come from different places
and backgrounds, there are specialists with deep knowlege in many fields:
mathematics, C++ and GPU programming, Javascript and web technologies, UX,
testing, and more that I have not yet explored. The synergy makes it a win-win
for all involved. When I get stuck, a world-class expert is available and we
can all help each other move forward.

Lucky me, you say, but why am I bothering to share my good fortune and make
you all jealous? Here is one take-away for the experienced developers out
there, keep posted for more as my journey progresses.

I was very hesitant to make the leap into a new career. I am no spring chicken,
and I was worried that I would not be able to find a suitable position. I only
began my software developer career late in life after I tired of
electrical design and contracting. But I am here to tell you that even an old
dog can learn new tricks. I began my open source chapter as a volunteer,
which improved my programming powers and led to meeting people outside
my usual circle. This led to the NumPy grant that led to Quansight Labs. So if
I could do it, others can too.

Joining Quansight Labs was definitely the right step for me. I hope you also
find your paths enjoyable and rewarding.
