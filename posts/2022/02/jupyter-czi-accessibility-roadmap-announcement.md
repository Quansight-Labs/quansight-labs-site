## Really? Tell me more.

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has funded efforts to make the Jupyter ecosystem, 
starting with JupyterLab, more accessible (As was announced in [a prior Jupyter blog post about grants in the ecosystem](https://blog.jupyter.org/czi-awards-three-eoss-grants-to-jupyter-community-members-6aef43bd9468)). 
You can read the [full grant proposal for Jupyter accessibility](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/blob/master/grant-applications/Inclusive_and_Accessible_Scientific_Computing_in_Jupyter_Ecosystem_SUBMITTED_PROPOSAL.pdf), 
the [proposal summary](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/inclusive-and-accessible-scientific-computing-in-the-jupyter-ecosystem/), 
or a [GitHub Project list of the grant's milestones](https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/projects/5) 
to get a sense of the grant's scope.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

As a part of these increased efforts, the team will be providing a 
periodically updated list of what is currently being worked on and what is 
coming soon. This document will help the community stay up-to-date and 
contribute if interested.

## Where can I find the roadmap?

[The Jupyter accessibility grant roadmap is right here!](https://jupyter-a11y.netlify.app/roadmap/intro.html) 

If you can't get enough of this news, you may want to visit the 
[grant management repository](https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt) 
where the roadmap is coordinated. It has additional resources like weekly team 
updates and issues for later on than the roadmap currently covers.

## How can I get involved with the project?

First of all, thank you for wanting to make Jupyter more accessible. This 
project is public and open to the community, so contributions of all kinds 
are accepted.
