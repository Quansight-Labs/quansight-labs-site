# Blog Post - My Internship experience

About months ago, when I was looking for resources to learn about accessibility and open sources, I came across Isabela's blogposts.

My passion for design and my interest in accessibility landed me here. In this blog post, I would like to share my internship experience at QuansightLabs and all I could learn about accessibility.

You might find this blog post a little different from others. There isn't much technical knowledge I'll be sharing here, but mostly the emotions behind what I have learned all this long.

## First Month - in an ocean full of resources

My specialization for the internship was accessibility and to help me learn more about it and its applications. I was completely new to the subject. There were times when I came across it in online courses I took on Human-Computer Interaction but never got the chance to get a first-hand experience with it.

As I was getting familiar with the topic, knowing people around here - things got a little overwhelming. I found the gem! - the accessibility channel with resources from around the World on different applications of accessibility.
