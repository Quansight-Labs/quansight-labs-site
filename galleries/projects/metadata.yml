title: PyData Sparse 
description: Sparse arrays, or arrays that are mostly empty or filled with zeros, are common in many scientific applications. To save space we often avoid storing these arrays in traditional dense formats, and instead choose different data structures. Our choice of data structure can significantly affect our storage and computational costs when working with these arrays. Sparse implements sparse arrays of arbitrary dimension on top of numpy and scipy.sparse. It generalizes the scipy.sparse.coo_matrix and scipy.sparse.dok_matrix layouts, but extends beyond just rows and columns to an arbitrary number of dimensions.
