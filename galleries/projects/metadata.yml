title: NumPy
description: "<p> NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things: a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. </p> <p> Quansight Labs helps support and shape the NumPy community by providing grant administration for the CZI EOSS program and directly funding maintainers to do technical and community work. As a result of this support, NumPy has also recently seen the launch of a new website and the establishment of both a website and a documentation team. </p>"

description: <p>JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.</p> <p>By supporting the work of maintainers, designers, and community organizers, Quansight Labs has assisted the JupyterLab community in improving accessibility and enabling internationalization for JupyterLab. The Jupyter Working Group (JWG), also supported by Labs, has been working on new functional and technical ideas for Jupyter in general. Finally, innovation projects like the Extensions Manager and the Real Time Collaboration for JupyterLab are funded via Labs. This work has been supported by both a Community Work Order from Kite and a CZI grant administered by Quansight Labs.</p>

It is used in a variety of fields, from climate science to biology to store from single images to petabytes datasets and their metadata.</p> <p>Quansight Labs has been working with the Zarr core team to write a new specification, which strives to be more language agnostic, contain a smaller core of functionality, and have built-in support for extensibility. We are also working with our partners at D.E. Shaw Group to bring optimizations to Zarr, like the ability to partially decompress and/or read data chunks in order to improve specific workflow. Zarr has also benefited from a CZI grant supported by Labs.</p>

title: PyData Sparse
description: Sparse arrays, or arrays that are mostly empty or filled with zeros, are common in many scientific applications. To save space we often avoid storing these arrays in traditional dense formats, and instead choose different data structures. Our choice of data structure can significantly affect our storage and computational costs when working with these arrays. Sparse implements sparse arrays of arbitrary dimension on top of numpy and scipy.sparse. It generalizes the scipy.sparse.coo_matrix and scipy.sparse.dok_matrix layouts, but extends beyond just rows and columns to an arbitrary number of dimensions.
