title: NumPy
description: "<p> NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things: a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. </p> <p> Quansight Labs helps support and shape the NumPy community by providing grant administration for the CZI EOSS program and directly funding maintainers to do technical and community work. As a result of this support, NumPy has also recently seen the launch of a new website and the establishment of both a website and a documentation team. </p>"
