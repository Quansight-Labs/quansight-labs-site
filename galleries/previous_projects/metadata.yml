title: XND
description: We are building XND to recreate the foundations of NumPy as a number of smaller libraries, combining the lessons learned in the past twenty years of array computing in Python with the needs of newer applications. This is not a replacement of NumPy. Eventually, NumPy could use XND as could Pandas, Dask, and other libraries.
