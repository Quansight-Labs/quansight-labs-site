<!--Hi there! If you aren't submitting a blog post, you can delete this message.

Thank you for submitting a blog post! We want to make sure content produced for Quansight Labs is accessible, so please address the the following guidelines in your post.-->


Text styling
- [ ] The blog is written with [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/) (where relevant).
- [ ] If there are headers, they use the proper header tags in order to do so (with only one level-one header).
- [ ] All links describe where they link to (for example, check the [Quansight labs website](https://labs.quansight.org/)).
- [ ] Any kind of styling that the author uses (for example, bold for emphasis) is consistent throughout the blog.

Non-text content
- [ ] All content is represented as text (for example, images need alt text and videos need captions or descriptive transcripts).
- [ ] If there are emojis, there are not more than three in a row.
- [ ] Don't use [flashing gifs or videos](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html).
- [ ] If it were to be read as plain text, the blog still makes sense and no information is missing.
