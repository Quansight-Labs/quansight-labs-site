involving more users in the community and making Spyder useful for a larger
number of people. With this, a new idea came: Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past months, we have been wondering with the team whether Spyder
could also serve as a teaching-learning platform, especially in this era
where remote instruction has become necessary. We submitted a proposal to the
Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program of the Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative, during its third cycle, with the idea of providing a
simple way inside Spyder to create and share interactive tutorials on topics
relevant to scientific research. Unfortunately, we didn’t get this funding,
but we didn’t let this great idea die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We submitted a second proposal to the &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/psf/"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
from which we were awarded $4000. For me, this is the perfect opportunity for
us to take the first step towards using Spyder for education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/czi-awards-4-7-million-for-open-source-software-and-organizations-advancing-open-science/"&gt;Cycle 3 of the Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) program&lt;/a&gt;.
This new grant totaling $140,000 will fund part of our efforts to improve
usability and sustainability in both projects and is excellent news for the
scientific computing community, which will certainly benefit from this work
downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
