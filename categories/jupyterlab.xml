&lt;h3&gt;JupyterLab Accessibility Journey Part 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be honest with you, I started asking accessibility questions
in JupyterLab spaces while filled with anxiety. Anxiety that I was shouting
into the void and no one else would work on accessibility with me. Anxiety
that I didn’t have the skills or energy or knowledge to back up what I
wanted to do. Anxiety that I was going to do it wrong and make JupyterLab
even more inaccessible. Sometimes I still feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;JupyterLab Accessibility Journey Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I've been part of a group of people in the JupyterLab community 
who've committed to start chipping away at the many accessibility failings of JupyterLab. 
I find this work is critical, fascinating, and a learning experience for everyone involved. 
So I'm going to document my personal experience and lessons I've learned in a series of blog 
posts. Welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

improvements to the extension system. Theming is a way to extend JupyterLab and 
benefits from those improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While theming is often disregarded as a purely cosmetic endeavour, it can greatly
improve software. Theming can be great help for accessibility, and the Jupyter team
pays attention to making the default appearance accessibility-aware by using
sufficient contrast.  For users with a high visual acuity you may also choose 
to increase the information density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theming can also be a great way to improve communication by increasing or
decreasing emphasis of the user interface, which can be of use for teaching or
presenting. Theming may also help with security, for example, by having a clear
distinction between staging and production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally Theming can be a great way to express oneself, for example, by using
a branded version of software that fits well into a context, or expressing one's artistic
preferences or opinions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following blog post, we will show you step-by-step how you can
develop a custom theme for JupyterLab, distribute it, and take the example of the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-theme-winter"&gt;jupyterlab-theme-winter&lt;/a&gt; theme we release today to celebrate the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
