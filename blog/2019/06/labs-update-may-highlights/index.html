<p>Time flies when you're having fun. Here is an update of some of the highlights
of my second month at Quansight Labs.</p>
<h3>The making of a black hole image &amp; GitHub Sponsors</h3>
<p>Both Travis and myself were invited by GitHub to attend GitHub Satellite in
Berlin. The main reason was that Nat Friedman (GitHub CEO) decided to spend the
first 20 minutes of his keynote to highlight the <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/">Event Horizon
Telescope's</a> black hole image and the open
source software that made that imaging possible. This included the scientific
Python very prominently - NumPy, Matplotlib, Python, Cython, SciPy, AstroPy and
other projects were highlighted. At the same time, Nat introduced new GitHub
features like "used by", a triaging role and new dependency graph features and
illustrated how those worked for NumPy. These features will be very welcome
news to maintainers of almost any project.</p>
<p><img alt="GitHub Satellite'19 keynote, showcasing NumPy and Matplotlib" src="../../../../images/githubsatellite_keynote_numpy_matplotlib.png"></p>
<p>The single most visible feature introduced was <strong>GitHub Sponsors</strong>:</p>
<p><img alt="GitHub Sponsors enabled on the NumPy repo" src="../../../../images/github_sponsors_screenshot.png"></p>
<p>I really enjoyed meeting <a href="https://devonzuegel.com">Devon Zuegel</a>, Product
Manager of the Open Source Economy Team at GitHub, in person after previously
having had the chance to exchange ideas with her about the funding related
needs of scientific Python projects and their core teams. I'm confident that
GitHub Sponsors will evolve in a direction that's beneficial to
community-driven open source projects.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>It was also a pleasure meeting many people I have interacted with before or
knew only by name, from core Python and Cython developers like Matthias Klose,
Mariatta Wijaya, Stefan Behnel and Christian Heimes, to scientific Python
maintainers like Antony Lee (Matplotlib), Marc Garcia (Pandas) and Brigitta
Sipocz (AstroPy).  The next day I took advantage of the opportunity to visit
<a href="https://maintainerati.org/">Maintainerati</a> (highly recommended!) to exchange
ideas and experiences with a completely different set of maintainers, from
communities as diverse as Node/Javascript, Kubernetes and Debian.</p>
<h3>Array computing</h3>
<p>Stefan Krah added support for "flexible arrays" to <a href="https://xnd.io">XND</a>. These
arrays are capable of supporting GeoJSON, which is an important format for
geospatial data. It's highly nested and irregularly shaped, so supporting it is
nontrivial - as far as we're aware, XND is the only array library able to do
this.</p>
<p>Hameer Abbasi participated in the NumPy sprint at BIDS, which focused on the
redesign of the dtype system. The NumPy team also made significant progress
towards NumPy 1.17, which is shaping up to be the most interesting NumPy
release in a long time. The <code>numpy.fft</code> and <code>numpy.random</code> modules are almost
completely rewritten (faster and more accurate FFTs, and new higher-quality
random number generators!), and the <code>__array_function__</code> protocol will be
enabled by default. Hameer also received good feedback on
<a href="http://github.com/quansight-labs/uarray">uarray</a> and improved the internals as
a result, resulting in much lower overhead and a much less nested call stack.</p>
<h3>JupyterLab</h3>
<p>The Jupyter developers at Quansight have been busy. The list of issues in the
<a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/milestone/2">JupyterLab 1.0 milestone</a>
is shrinking rapidly. The final release is expected in June, which will mark a
huge achievement of the JupyterLab team.</p>
<p>There has also been significant work going into two new features that are
planned for release post-1.0. Quoting team lead Ryan Henning:</p>
<p>"<em>JupyterLab's Data Registry</em> will have its first release on July 12 and will
make it easier for developers to create data-centric extensions for JupyterLab.
The concept of "a dataset" will finally be a first-class entity within
JupyterLab, which will ignite tremendous potential for data-centric interactive
plugins.</p>
<p>The debut of <em>JupyterLab's built-in commenting feature</em> will be on June 28 of
this year! It will include the ability to comment on any file in JupyterLab,
and even the ability to comment on individual lines of text/code within source
files."</p>
<h3>Spyder</h3>
<p>The Spyder team grew in May - I was very happy to welcome
<a href="https://github.com/andfoy">Edgar Andrés Margffoy Tuay</a> to Quansight. With Carlos,
Gonzalo and Edgar we now have three Spyder maintainers at Quansight Labs. It's
great to see the momentum of the Spyder project increasing.</p>
<p>On 21 May the second beta of Spyder 4.0 was released - it was 8 months in the
making. The most visible features are the new dark theme and the plots pane:</p>
<p><img alt="Spyder main window, showing a figure displayed in the plots pane" src="../../../../images/spyder-plots.png"></p>
<p>There's a lot more though - from Language Server Protocol integration to better
<code>pandas.DataFrame</code> support and dedicated Cython, SymPy and Pylab consoles.
Gonzalo's <a href="http://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/05/spyder-4-beta2-release/">blog post</a>
goes into a lot more detail on this release.</p>
<h3>Other PyData core projects</h3>
<p>Aaron Meurer is co-mentoring <em>three</em> Google Summer of Code projects for SymPy.
SymPy has always benefited a lot from participating in GSoC, with a large part
of SymPy's core team having started out via the program. This year seems to be
shaping up to be a successful one again, so this is a great way for Aaron to
invest his time.</p>
<p>For SciPy, I finalized the <a href="https://tidelift.com/">Tidelift</a> agreement (see the
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/scipy-dev/2019-May/023542.html">announcement</a>
for details). A steady project income of $2500/month is very nice to have, it
gives the SciPy team the opportunity to do things like organize a developer
meeting or pay for activities that are hard to get done otherwise (e.g. a
long overdue website redesign).</p>
<p>My largest time investment this month for NumPy and SciPy was interacting with
tech writers who are interested in participating in the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/">Google Season of Docs</a> program.
The quality and enthusiasm of potential applicants has exceeded all my
expectations, and I'm really looking forward to involving talented writers in
the projects.</p>
<h3>Measuring Python API usage</h3>
<p>Chris Ostrouchov cracked a tough nut: coming up with a practical method to
determine how heavily functions in an API are used, and in what ways. This
allows maintainers to obtain hard data when considering questions like <em>"can we
deprecate this function?"</em> or <em>"what should we focus on in our
documentation?"</em>. Chris wrote a
<a href="http://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/05/python-package-function-usage/">detailed blog post</a>
on his methodology and initial results. He continues to improve his method in
<a href="https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/python-api-inspect">python-api-inspect</a>, and
will soon be able to give people an interface to formulate their own questions.
There's a lot more to come here!</p>
<h3>Funding - Community Work Orders</h3>
<p>Within Quansight we're starting to get a much clearer vision for how Labs
funding will work, and in particular the concept of a <em>Community Work Order</em>
(CWO). In
<a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/05/community-driven-opensource-funded-development/">this blog post</a>
I articulate our current vision in some detail. It's a nuanced proposition,
however we're finding that the concept appeals to companies that have an
interest in supporting one or more core PyData projects. It strikes a nice
balance between giving project core teams the freedom to set directions and
work on things that benefit their whole community, and still meeting specific
needs that companies may have.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to being able to announce new CWOs in June.</p>
