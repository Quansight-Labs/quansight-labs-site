<p>I'm very happy to announce that I have joined <a href="https://www.quansight.com/">Quansight</a> as a front-end developer and designer! It was a happy coincidence how I joined- the intersection of my skills and the open source community's expanded vision.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>I met Ralf Gommers, the director of <a href="https://www.quansight.com/labs">Quansight Labs</a>, at the PyData Conference in New York City last year after giving a Lightning Talk. <strong>However, as cool and confident as this may sound, I sure didn't start off that way.</strong></p>
<p>At that point, it's been a few months since I graduated from a coding bootcamp. I was feeling down in the job-search funk. I hadn't even done much in Python, since my focus was in Javascript.</p>
<p><img alt="PyData NYC Banner" src="../../../../images/codesprite-comics/PyData-NYC-Banner.jpg"></p>
<p>When I first heard about <a href="https://pydata.org/">PyData</a> and its <a href="https://pydata.org/diversity-inclusion/">Diversity Scholar</a> program, I didn't think either applied to me. I didn't feel like I knew enough Python nor deserve a place to learn more about it. I'm always eager to learn something new, but PyData felt too out of my reach.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my friend who was a volunteer at PyData really encouraged me to apply. I gave it a shot. I was rejected at first - I didn't quite make the cut. I was disappointed and accepted it.</p>
<p>But a second round of funding came in from partner organizations. Now, they could bring in more Diversity Scholars. I was elated to have the chance! Their trust in me gave me the confidence to go. It totally changed my point of view from self-doubt to eagerness.</p>
<p>Once I was at PyData, I signed up for the Lightning Talks, knowing that it would be a great way for me to talk about my personal project, the 'Codesprite Explains' comics.</p>
<p>The 'Codesprite' comics break down code concepts into fun and visual ways. It was inspired by my desire to turn my boring written notes into something more personal.</p>
<p><img alt="Page 1 of first Codepsrite comic" src="../../../../images/codesprite-comics/CodeSprite-part-1.png"><img alt="Page 2 of first Codepsrite comic" src="../../../../images/codesprite-comics/CodeSprite-part-2.png"><em>First two pages of my personal project, 'Codesprite Explains'</em></p>
<p>At my Lightning Talk, I was confident. <strong>No longer did I doubt that I could be here- to take up space and stand up tall.</strong> I introduced myself as a Diversity Scholar. I was unabashedly unashamed to be new to Python and eager to learn. I delighted in showing off my artistic skills that give me so much joy and that aren’t common in this community. I laughed with the crowd at my cheesy puns.</p>
<p>When I finished my talk, I realized I came a long way from where I started. So when Ralf congratulated me, I was already feeling good. When he asked if I was interested in joining Quansight, that was the most unexpected-yet-awesomest cherry on top!</p>
<p><img alt="Author giving a Lightning Talk at PyData NYC" src="../../../../images/codesprite-comics/PyData-Lightning-Talk.png"><em>The author giving a Lightning Talk at PyData NYC</em></p>
<p>In my next blog post, I'll talk about my first impressions of Quansight and what made me say 'yes'.</p>
<p>Before ending this post, I would like to recap a few things.</p>
<p><strong>There were some initial barriers that prevented me from joining the open-source space.</strong> Without knowing people involved in the community, such as my friend volunteering there, I wouldn't have known about PyData. Without the financial assistance of the Diversity Scholar program, I wouldn't have been able to afford a ticket as an unemployed graduate. A lack of technical knowledge itself isn't prohibitive, but when combined with the above factors, stops many other capable people from entering this space.</p>
<p>I was able to overcome these barriers with a combination of external and internal factors. The Diversity Scholars program putting trust into newcomers like me, my growing confidence and a welcoming community.</p>
<p>I look forward to contributing to the open-source community!</p>
