# Quansight Labs Site

## Creating new posts

Use either reStructuredText, Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks. To create an empty post:
```
$ nikola new_post -f markdown  # default is .rst if not specified
```

Note that for Jupyter notebook posts the post metadata (title, author, slug, date) goes in the notebook metadata as documented [here](https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#jupyter-notebook-metadata). Jupyter Lab does not have a metadata editor yet - either use Jupyter notebook, install https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterlab-nbmetadata (although that did not work in a first test), or edit the metadata by hand.

To not show the whole post but only the first bit and then `read more ...`, use `<!-- TEASER_END -->` (either in plain Markdown or in a Markdown cell in a notebook).
